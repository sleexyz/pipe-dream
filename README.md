# piped
drawn programming language?

Free programming from symbolic formalisms...
...to general abstract formalism!

### ...reify that please?
#### (Visual) SYNTAX
- String-diagram-inspired *extruded* commutative diagrams
- basically encodes AST

#### SEMANTICS
- Higher-order lambda calculus

#### PARSING
- Nonlinear parsing?
- Computer Vision?
- Type inference?

#### INTERPRETATATION
- isomorphism with line-based syntax? (Subset of haskell?)


### Use case?
- DSL
- General purpose, but would have to think about ergonomics...
